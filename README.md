Project name: 	**Lego Segway Stabilization**

Team members: 	hsjx15, Team_mate

Work Assignment:
- hsjx15: Simulink Model Building
- Team_mate: Hardware Testing

The goal of this project is to design a controller to stabilize a Lego model of a Segway. This will be done by creating a nonlinear model of the Segway, designing a linear controller to stabilize it, and downloading the controller into the Lego Mindstorms EV3 hardware package.
